# Document / Windows objects

## Document

The document object is primarily concerned with the content and structure of the HTML document, while the window object deals with the overall browser environment, providing global methods and properties for managing the window and interacting with the browser. Both objects are crucial for JavaScript development in a web context, and they often work together to enable dynamic and interactive web pages.

document Object:

The document object represents the entire HTML document in a web page.
It provides methods and properties to interact with the content of the document, such as manipulating elements, changing styles, and handling events.
For example, you can use document.getElementById() to get a reference to an HTML element by its ID or document.createElement() to create a new HTML element dynamically.
javascript
## Example: Getting an element by ID
var myElement = document.getElementById('exampleId');

## Window 

The window object represents the browser window or frame that contains the document.
It is the top-level object in the browser's object hierarchy and serves as the global object for JavaScript in the browser environment.
It provides methods and properties for controlling the browser window, handling events at the window level, and managing the global scope.
Additionally, the window object includes properties like window.location for information about the URL of the document, window.alert() for displaying alerts, and window.setTimeout() for executing code after a specified time interval.
javascript
## Example
window.open('https://www.example.com', '_blank');
